            <h1>Justhost Sucks.</h1>
            <h2>Why does Justhost suck?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">Justhost has grown so large by employing very low sign-up pricing with a huge increase in prices when it comes time to renew. At this point they have you and you are stuck with them, because it is quite difficult to change over to a new justing company.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>It truly is a trap!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">Because of this Justhost does not consider any specific customer as important or relevant. So, expect to be treated as just a number</li>
                <li class="list-text">Justhost has extremely poor customer service</li>
                <li class="list-text">Justhost has excessive telephone support wait times</li>
                <li class="list-text">When you do get through the operator they have very limited access and cannot resolve serious problems so they create a ticket for escalated support</li>
                <li class="list-text">The same is true for Justhost Live Chat, who will ask you, exactly what you just asked them over and over again as if you are a 5 year old child, until you become infuriated. Eventually, if you push them, you will be given a support ticket for escalated support</li>
                <li class="list-text">Escalated support can <strong>only be contacted</strong> via email and are not open on weekends. Response times are usually 2 to 3 days and are usually just a canned response. So, if it is urgent or mission critical Justhost will not lift a finger to help you or take any notice of any damage they are doing to you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Justhost just does not care less about you or your business, only your credit card number</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">If there is anything unusual such as an invalid Auth Code or EPP code, login issue, emails not being received, incorrect charges etc. it will literally take you months to have this resolved, if at all, because escalated support will just say the same thing over and over again no matter how many times you explain it to them</li>
                <li class="list-text">If you complain about this they just close the ticket and you have to start all over again</li>
            </ul>
